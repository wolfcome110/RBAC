### Motivation

This project was initiated in mid-2012. The motivation for developing this project was the need to learn to use the GitHub tools for source code management.

During the development of this project I learned new concepts and development techniques.  So I decided to keep it as a knowledge source for new developers and a contribution to the open source community.
